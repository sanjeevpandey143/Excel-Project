Walmart Retail Data Analysis & Dynamic Dashboard
Project Overview
This Excel project focuses on creating a dynamic dashboard for Walmart retail data analysis. The analysis is based on three data tables: Orders, Returns, and People, with data cleaning and transformation conducted via Power Query Editor. Key insights and visualizations were extracted to analyze sales, profits, order quantity, and market trends across various segments and regions.

Return Table: Provides information on returned orders, with Order IDs and corresponding Markets.
People Table: Contains details of individuals assigned to specific regions for analysis.
Objective
The main objective of this project is to:

Perform retail data analysis focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) like Sales, Profit, Order Quantity, and Market Share.
Provide a dynamic view of the data using slicers and filters for various categories such as market, segment, region, and shipping mode.
Create interactive charts and visuals that allow deep-dive analysis into sales performance, profit margins, regional market share, and product category trends.
